# Words
Type in letters and see the possible words that contain those letters in the accepted letters or the correct placement of the letter in the word. You can also type in rejected letters to exclude words with those letters in them. 

Download the exe or command file as well as the englishwords.txt and run gui.exe to run the application. Make sure that the txt file is in the same folder as the exe or command file when you run it.
